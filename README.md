# TUK-Bioinformatics-Seminar

Bioinformatics Hub of Kenya Initiative (BHKi) is a registered non-governmental organization under the rule of law of Kenya. Its vision is to be a vivacious, well-coordinated, enthusiastic hub that will develop bioinformatics skill sets by creating awareness, collaboration, and capacity development. BHKi’s mission is to bridge the gap between well-established bioinformaticians and aspiring ones through peer training and mentorship to enhance collaboration to foster quality scientific research and promote sharing of data, skills and codes.

This year, one of our annual target goals is to sensitise bioinformatics to undergraduate and high school levels through an outreach program. This involves holding seminars, talks and workshops at universities and schools to encourage undergraduates and high school students to take up bioinformatics projects and consider bioinformatics as a career option. The ultimate goal is to grow our bioinformatics capacity as it is a growing field.

We plan to start sensitizing universities in Nairobi. To start, we intend to start with one of the public universities, the Technical University of Kenya, under the invitation of Dr Peris Amwayi, Chairperson of the Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology. The theme of the seminar is “Trends in bioinformatics”. The expected outcome of the seminar is students will get a general perspective of bioinformatics and have a networking session with ten Kenyan masters and PhD students in attendance. The seminar is scheduled on the 31st May 2022 from 10 am - 12 pm EAT.
